- this folder contains all necessary files for this application
- URL to run the application http://localhost:8888/responsive_web_design/view/newPage.php
 
How does the Application works:
- I implemented test page as Requested -> used HTML / CSS / JS (jQuery/ajax) and some cropped images
- only one Menu has some submenus ‚Who we are‘  - links are inactive 
- Function: 
* User is able to select a Donation amount and Submit it
* Ajax is used to pass the amount to PHP Controller
* if the response is successful, a dialog box with the selected Amount will popup
- Slider function is working and you can slider to next and previous images by clicking on the arrow
- the Page is designed to be responsive
